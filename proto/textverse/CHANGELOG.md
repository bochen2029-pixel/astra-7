# textverse changelog

Per-day implementation entries. Each entry should include: what was built, what tests pass, any findings that affect the spec.

## Unreleased

### Day 0 — Scaffolding (2026-05-15)

- `pyproject.toml` — Python 3.12 project, uv-managed, dependency set locked
- `README.md`, `STARTUP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — bootstrap docs
- `.gitignore` — Python project ignores + scenario output artifacts
- Empty `astra/` package skeleton matching `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 layout
- `tests/conftest.py` + one sanity test confirming the package imports

**Status:** ready for Day 1 — Foundation (Pydantic types in `astra/core/` + `astra/state_bus/schema.py`).
